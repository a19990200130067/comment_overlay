# comment_overlay

## What is this?
This is a firefox add-on that creates an overlay window that displays rolling comments (aka. Danmaku).

## What's it for?
This can become handy if you want the rolling comments experience from Asian video-sharing sites while watching shows on Netflix or Youtube.
I personally use this when watching animes on Netflix.

## How to install it?
As this is still work-in-progress, you could only install it through `about:debugging` page of firefox
[[HowTo](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/)].

## How to use it?
1. Enter the video ID into the popup window of the add-on. Currently, it could only pull comments from Bilibili
2. Click "Start Overlay"
3. Drag & resize the overlay window over the video
4. Enjoy!

If the video itself is rendered in a html `<video>` tag, this add-on will automatically sync with the video playtime.
So feel free to pause the video or drag the seekbar.
